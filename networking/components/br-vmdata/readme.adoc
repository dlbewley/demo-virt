= BR-VMData

Define a bridge for attaching Virtual Machines to "pyhysical" VLANs in the datacenter. This bridge is on an additional NIC or Bond as opposed to the existing `br-ex` bridge on the default interface.

Assumes hypervisors have a 2nd interface to carry virtual machine traffic.
The default is `ens224` this can be patched in link:../../../../networking/overlays/homelab[an overlay].

The bridge carries the tagged VLANs which are fed to the ens224 interface via 802.1q trunk from the physical switch.

Bridge `br-vmdata` may be of type "Linux Bridge" or "OVS Bridge". Choose of of the following.

.Are your tags really here?
[TIP]
====
It's very common to find that a VLAN tag is not being trunk everwhere it is expected to be. You can use `tcpdump` to validate the presence of the expected VLAN tags.

.Using tcpdump on OpenShift Node
[source,bash]
----
oc debug node/$NODE
chroot /host
toolbox
tcpdump -i $INTERFACE -nn -e vlan
----

== OVS Bridge

link:ovs-bridge[]

Creates an OVS-Bridge which provides features like MultiNetworkPolicy and many pending features like IPAM.

Networks will be mapped to the bridge via OVS bridge-mappings. See example NetworkAttachmentDefinition and NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy link:../../vlan-1924/ovs-bridge[here].

== Linux Bridge

link:linux-bridge[]

Creates a legacy linux-bridge interface which can not take advantage of current or future OVN enhancements.

Bridge VLAN Filtering feature allows for NetworkAttachmentDefinitions to attach bridge ports to a pod (VM) which relay untagged VLAN traffic. As an alternative a VLAN interface may be created first and a bridge attached to each. This is slightly less efficient.
